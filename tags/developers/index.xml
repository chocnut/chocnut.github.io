I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding websites for years now and honestly, I had to chime in with my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know what&amp;rsquo;s funny? AI feels like a super-powered Google search mixed with those old Visual Studio tools. Remember ReSharper from like 2008? Yeah, showing my age here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still cringe thinking about my first Stack Overflow question. I tried everything, pulled my hair out for hours, finally got the courage to post and&amp;hellip; man, those comments were savage. &amp;ldquo;Did you even try Google?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;RTFM!&amp;rdquo; I was so discouraged I didn&amp;rsquo;t post again for years. Now I just ask AI all my dumb questions without getting roasted. What a time to be alive, right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
