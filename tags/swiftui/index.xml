We have AI now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this happened recently and I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. My coworker saw me watching YouTube videos about SwiftUI and he&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;hellip; why? Just why would you bother learning SwiftUI with AI around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, fair question I guess. I&amp;rsquo;m doing ReactJS on web and React Native for mobile development. In this 2025 tech market, I should probably be learning system design or whatever - you need to know everything instead of being a generalist to stay marketable. When I told him I already know that stuff, he&amp;rsquo;s like yeah okay but still. The look on his face though. Like I was doing something completely pointless.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
