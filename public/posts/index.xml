      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a hot debate on Reddit about AI replacing front-end developers. As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been in the industry coding websites for years, I wanted to share my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ais-impact-on-front-end-development&#34;&gt;AI&amp;rsquo;s Impact on Front-End Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, AI is like a super-powered Google search combined with those old Visual Studio tools, ReSharper from 2008 showing my age here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: I still remember my first Stack Overflow question. After trying EVERYTHING and pulling my hair out, I finally worked up the courage to post. And wow&amp;hellip; those comments were brutal! &amp;ldquo;Did you even try Google?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;RTFM!&amp;rdquo; I was so discouraged I didn&amp;rsquo;t post again for years. ðŸ˜… Now I just ask AI the &amp;ldquo;dumb questions&amp;rdquo; without judgment - what a time to be alive!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the year ends, Iâ€™ve been thinking about everything thatâ€™s happenedâ€”the good, the bad, and what Iâ€™ve learned. Things didnâ€™t always go the way I wanted, but the surprises helped me grow in ways I didnâ€™t expect. Theyâ€™ve also set me up for whatâ€™s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving my kids back to the Philippines was tough. Things werenâ€™t working out as planned, and bringing them back home wasnâ€™t what I had in mind. But it was the right choice for our family. It showed me that life can be unpredictable, and you just have to roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
