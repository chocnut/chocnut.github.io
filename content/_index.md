Hi, I'm Peter! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Filipino software developer with 16 years of experience building web and mobile applications. Currently working with ReactJS, React Native and exploring SwiftUI, I love sharing my thoughts on programming, AI's impact on development, and the journey of being a developer.

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my family (husband and dad of three), going for runs, gym, or learning something new just because it's interesting.

Check out my [latest posts](/posts/) or learn more [about me](/about/).
