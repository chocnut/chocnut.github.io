Hi, I'm Peter! I'm a Filipino software developer with 16 years of experience building web and mobile applications. Throughout my career, I've worked with various technologies but currently focus on React Native for mobile development while exploring SwiftUI on the side.

## What I Do

I specialize in frontend and mobile development, with experience in:

- React Native and ReactJS
- Mobile app development
- Web development
- System design and architecture

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm a husband and dad of three who loves staying active through running. I believe in lifelong learning - whether it's a new programming language, framework, or just understanding how things work.

I started this blog to share my thoughts on programming, the impact of AI on development, and the experiences that come with being a developer in this constantly evolving field.
