So here we are at the end of 2024 and honestly, what a year it's been. Not always in the way I expected, but life rarely goes according to plan anyway, right?

The biggest thing that happened was moving my kids back to the Philippines. That was... tough. Things weren't working out the way we hoped and bringing them back home wasn't part of the original plan. But sometimes you just have to make the hard calls for your family, you know? It sucked at the time but looking back, it was the right choice.

I guess it taught me that I'm more adaptable than I thought. Life throws curveballs and you either learn to hit them or you strike out. I'm still learning to hit them.

We also went to Japan this year which was incredible. Like, I can't even explain it properly but something about that place just clicked with me. Now I'm randomly thinking about maybe living there someday. Not anytime soon obviously, but it's sitting in the back of my mind now.

Oh and I finally ran a marathon. I've been saying I wanted to do that before I turn 40 and well... I actually did it. The funny thing is it wasn't really about the goal anymore once I started training.

Earlier this year I had a health checkup and my heart wasn't looking great. That scared the hell out of me if I'm being honest. So I started running in March, just using some coaching app and doing short runs. Slowly worked my way up - 10Ks, half marathons, then the full thing.

It wasn't just about finishing though. It was about proving to myself that I could stick with something when it got hard. Plus running became this weird therapy thing for me. Helped with stress and anxiety and all that.

On the tech side, I spent a lot of time learning Go this year. Even shipped some apps with it which felt pretty good. Made me think about moving away from JavaScript for some projects and trying different approaches to solving problems.

Also got deeper into Terraform and AWS. Managing infrastructure used to intimidate me but now it's kind of fun in a weird way.

But the real game changer has been AI stuff. It's not just hype anymore, it's actually changing how I work day to day. I want to keep learning about these tools and figure out how to use them to make coding more creative and less tedious. Could be huge for me and my family down the road.

Next year feels like it's going to bring some big changes. I'm not exactly sure what yet but I have this feeling things are going to shift in a good way.

Anyway, I'm grateful for this year. To my family and friends who put up with all my random decisions and stress - thank you. Seriously.

2025, here we come. Ready for whatever you throw at me.
