As the year wraps up, I’ve been thinking about everything that’s happened. The highs, the lows, and the lessons I’ve learned. Things didn’t always go as planned, but the unexpected twists helped me grow in ways I didn’t see coming. They’ve also set the stage for what’s to come in the new year.

# Overcoming obstacles, staying strong, and finding hope

Moving my kids back to the Philippines was tough. I realised that things weren’t going smoothly, and bringing them home again wasn’t what I’d envisioned. But it was the right call for our family. It reminded me that life can be random and weird sometimes—that's the way it is.

I learned a lot about adapting, staying resilient, and holding onto hope during those ups and downs. It wasn’t what I had in mind, but it taught me that every setback can lead to something better.

We also visited Japan, and it opened my mind to the idea of moving there. It’s definitely not happening soon, but it’s the best country I’ve visited so far. It felt like I was in a different world - I’m not sure why, to be honest.

# A major bucket list achievement

I’d promised myself I’d run a marathon before I turned 40, and this year, I finally did it. But it’s not just about ticking a box. After my annual check-up, I found out that my heart’s not in shape, and that scares me.

I started with a coach app doing short runs in March and gradually increased my distance. Soon, I was completing 10Ks, half marathons, and eventually, a full marathon. It wasn’t about finishing; it was about proving I could push through and stick to a plan. Running became a way to take control, clear my anxieties, celebrate life, and tap into an endurance I didn’t know I had.

# Exploring New Tech and Embracing the Future

This year, I dove deeper into new technologies. I got hands-on with Go and launched production apps. That experience taught me to consider ditching JavaScript and trying something new. It’s not the only way to solve real-world software problems.

I also improved my skills in Terraform and AWS. I got better at using IaC to manage complex infrastructure. But what I find really exciting is the impact AI is having on the programming world. AI is no longer just a buzzword; it’s changing how we work and create. It's a way to tackle more bucket list goals. I wo the new year with hope, thanks, and excitement for what’s next.ant to seize new tech opportunities and build a brighter future for my family: a new tools that can help us code more intelligently, efficiently, and creatively.

For me, AI represents an opportunity to explore uncharted territory in tech. It’s a thrilling time to be a programmer, and I’m eager to see where these new tools take us.

# Looking forward to a new chapter

Next year is shaping up to be one of the biggest years of change for my family and me. I’m not sure what it will look like yet, but I’m sure it will lead us to something better and more fulfilling.

# Grateful for the journey

As I wrap up this year, I’m filled with gratitude. To my family, friends, and colleagues—thanks for being there and cheering me on. Your support means a lot.

I’m heading into the new year with hope, thanks, and excitement for what’s next.
