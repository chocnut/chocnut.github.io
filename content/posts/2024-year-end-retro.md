As the year ends, I’ve been thinking about everything that’s happened—the good, the bad, and what I’ve learned. Things didn’t always go the way I wanted, but the surprises helped me grow in ways I didn’t expect. They’ve also set me up for what’s next.

# Dealing with challenges and finding hope

Moving my kids back to the Philippines was tough. Things weren’t working out as planned, and bringing them back home wasn’t what I had in mind. But it was the right choice for our family. It showed me that life can be unpredictable, and you just have to roll with it.

I learned how to adjust, stay strong, and keep hoping for better days. It didn’t turn out the way I wanted, but it taught me that setbacks can lead to something good.

We also visited Japan, and it got me thinking about maybe living there someday. It’s not happening anytime soon, but it’s the best place I’ve visited so far. It felt like a completely different experience, though I can’t quite explain why.

# Checking off a big goal

I’ve always wanted to run a marathon before I turned 40, and this year, I did it. But it wasn’t just about hitting that goal. After a health check showed my heart wasn’t in great shape, I was scared and knew I needed to do something about it.

I started with short runs in March using a coaching app and slowly built up to running 10Ks, half marathons, and finally a full marathon. It wasn’t just about finishing; it was about proving to myself that I could stick with something and push through challenges. Running helped me clear my mind, deal with stress, and anxiety.

# Trying new tech and looking ahead

This year, I spent more time learning new technologies. I worked with Go and even launched apps with it, which made me think about moving away from JavaScript and trying different ways to solve problems. I also got better with Terraform and AWS, using them to manage complex systems.

What’s really exciting is how AI is changing programming. It’s not just a buzzword anymore—it’s actually changing how we work. I want to keep learning about these tools and use them to make coding easier and more creative. I’m excited to see how this can help me and my family in the future.

# Looking forward

Next year feels like it’s going to bring some big changes for me and my family. I’m not sure what’s coming, but I’m hopeful it will lead to something better.

# Feeling thankful

As I finish this year, I feel grateful. To my family, and friends thank you for your support. It means a lot.

I’m ready to start the new year with hope and excitement for what’s ahead.
