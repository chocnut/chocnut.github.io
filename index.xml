We have AI now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this happened recently and I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. My coworker saw me watching YouTube videos about SwiftUI and he&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;hellip; why? Just why would you bother learning SwiftUI with AI around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, fair question I guess. I&amp;rsquo;m doing ReactJS on web and React Native for mobile development. In this 2025 tech market, I should probably be learning system design or whatever - you need to know everything instead of being a generalist to stay marketable. When I told him I already know that stuff, he&amp;rsquo;s like yeah okay but still. The look on his face though. Like I was doing something completely pointless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Will AI Replace Front-End Developers?</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/posts/will-ai-replace-front-end-developers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:06:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/posts/will-ai-replace-front-end-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>So there&amp;rsquo;s been this huge debate on Reddit about AI replacing front-end developers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding websites for years now and honestly, I had to chime in with my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know what&amp;rsquo;s funny? AI feels like a super-powered Google search mixed with those old Visual Studio tools. Remember ReSharper from like 2008? Yeah, showing my age here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still cringe thinking about my first Stack Overflow question. I tried everything, pulled my hair out for hours, finally got the courage to post and&amp;hellip; man, those comments were savage. &amp;ldquo;Did you even try Google?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;RTFM!&amp;rdquo; I was so discouraged I didn&amp;rsquo;t post again for years. Now I just ask AI all my dumb questions without getting roasted. What a time to be alive, right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 Year End Retro</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/posts/2024-year-end-retro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 11:58:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/posts/2024-year-end-retro/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here we are at the end of 2024 and honestly, what a year it&amp;rsquo;s been. Not always in the way I expected, but life rarely goes according to plan anyway, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest thing that happened was moving my kids back to the Philippines. That was&amp;hellip; tough. Things weren&amp;rsquo;t working out the way we hoped and bringing them back home wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the original plan. But sometimes you just have to make the hard calls for your family, you know? It sucked at the time but looking back, it was the right choice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/pages/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/pages/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Peter!
