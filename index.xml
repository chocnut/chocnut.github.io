We have AI now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this happened recently and I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it. My coworker saw me watching YouTube videos about SwiftUI and he&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;hellip; why? Just why would you bother learning SwiftUI with AI around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, fair question I guess. I&amp;rsquo;m doing ReactJS on web and React Native for mobile development. In this 2025 tech market, I should probably be learning system design or whatever - you need to know everything instead of being a generalist to stay marketable. When I told him I already know that stuff, he&amp;rsquo;s like yeah okay but still. The look on his face though. Like I was doing something completely pointless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Will AI Replace Front-End Developers?</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/posts/will-ai-replace-front-end-developers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:06:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/posts/will-ai-replace-front-end-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been a hot debate on Reddit about AI replacing front-end developers. As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been in the industry coding websites for years, I wanted to share my perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ais-impact-on-front-end-development">AI&amp;rsquo;s Impact on Front-End Development&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you think about it, AI is like a super-powered Google search combined with those old Visual Studio tools, ReSharper from 2008 showing my age here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact: I still remember my first Stack Overflow question. After trying EVERYTHING and pulling my hair out, I finally worked up the courage to post. And wow&amp;hellip; those comments were brutal! &amp;ldquo;Did you even try Google?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;RTFM!&amp;rdquo; I was so discouraged I didn&amp;rsquo;t post again for years. ðŸ˜… Now I just ask AI the &amp;ldquo;dumb questions&amp;rdquo; without judgment - what a time to be alive!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 Year End Retro</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/posts/2024-year-end-retro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 11:58:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/posts/2024-year-end-retro/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the year ends, Iâ€™ve been thinking about everything thatâ€™s happenedâ€”the good, the bad, and what Iâ€™ve learned. Things didnâ€™t always go the way I wanted, but the surprises helped me grow in ways I didnâ€™t expect. Theyâ€™ve also set me up for whatâ€™s next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Moving my kids back to the Philippines was tough. Things werenâ€™t working out as planned, and bringing them back home wasnâ€™t what I had in mind. But it was the right choice for our family. It showed me that life can be unpredictable, and you just have to roll with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://peterindiola.com/pages/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peterindiola.com/pages/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Peter!
